"""
Tradingview-webhooks-bot is a python bot that works with tradingview's webhook alerts!
This bot is not affiliated with tradingview and was created by @robswc

You can follow development on github at: github.com/robswc/tradingview-webhook-bot

I'll include as much documentation here and on the repo's wiki!  I
expect to update this as much as possible to add features as they become available!
Until then, if you run into any bugs let me know!
